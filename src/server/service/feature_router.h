/// Routing layer that assembles feature results from their providers.
///
/// A feature answer can come from three sources:
///   - the live AST: forwarded to the worker that holds the file's AST;
///   - build-companion caches: products derived while building the PCH
///     (e.g. the preamble's document links), cached master-side because the
///     worker's AST is built on top of the PCH and cannot see the preamble
///     region;
///   - the index: disk-derived shards queried through IndexQuery.
///
/// Features fall into two shapes. Whole-document results (document links,
/// semantic tokens, folding ranges, ...) have a payload determined entirely
/// by the document content, so they could in the future be served from a
/// content-addressed result cache. Position-parameterized queries
/// (definition, hover, completion) take a cursor and cannot be keyed that
/// way; for these the index could in the future grow into a complete
/// provider, serving files that are not open at all.
///
/// Discipline: any feature whose answer is assembled from more than one
/// source belongs here. Transports (LSP/agentic handlers) only translate
/// between the wire protocol and these methods — they never merge, retry,
/// or gate results themselves.
