/// Each dirty unit is compiled by an independent task spawned into the

/// requesters and dependent units merely wait on the round's completion
/// event. Lifecycle by phase:
///
/// - Request arrival: compile()/compile_deps() takes a root reference on the
///   requested unit(s) and waits. A dirty unit with no running round gets a
///   unit task spawned; the task acquires edge references on its direct
///   dependencies, waits for them, then dispatches its own compilation.
/// - Request cancel: the requester's frame unwinds and drops its root
///   reference. A unit whose interest stays at zero for an event-loop tick
///   has its round cancelled; the exiting task drops its edge references,
///   cascading the cancellation through no-longer-needed dependencies.
///   Shared dependencies keep compiling as long as any other consumer holds
///   interest, and a transient drop (a retry re-acquiring a retained
///   dependency after re-resolve) does not disturb the running compilation.
/// - File update: update() marks the unit and its transitive dependents
///   dirty and cancels their in-flight rounds — the results are stale.
///   Interest is NOT touched; waiters observe the stale round and drive a
///   fresh one with the new content.
/// - Compile finish: the unit task publishes success/failure through its
///   round and wakes waiters; success clears dirty, failure (compile error,
///   dependency cycle) propagates to waiters without retry.
