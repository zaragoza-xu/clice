# Test and Debug

## Run Tests

clice has three types of tests: unit tests, integration tests, and smoke tests.

All test dependencies (pytest, pygls, etc.) are managed by pixi — no separate installation needed.

### Unit Tests

```bash
pixi run unit-test          # default RelWithDebInfo
pixi run unit-test Debug    # debug build
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
./build/RelWithDebInfo/bin/unit_tests \
    --test-dir="./tests/data" \
    --snapshot-dir="./tests/snapshots" \
    --corpus-dir="./tests/corpus" \
    --verbose
```

### Integration Tests

End-to-end tests that start a real clice server and communicate via LSP protocol.

```bash
pixi run integration-test          # default RelWithDebInfo
pixi run integration-test Debug    # debug build
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
pytest -s --log-cli-level=INFO --timeout=300 --timeout-method=thread \
    tests/integration --executable=./build/RelWithDebInfo/bin/clice
```

### Smoke Tests

Replay recorded LSP sessions to catch regressions in protocol handling.

```bash
pixi run smoke-test          # default RelWithDebInfo
pixi run smoke-test Debug    # debug build
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
python tests/replay.py tests/smoke/*.jsonl \
    --clice=./build/RelWithDebInfo/bin/clice
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
pixi run test                # runs unit + integration + smoke
pixi run test Debug          # all tests with debug build
```

## Debug

If you want to attach a debugger to clice, start it in socket mode independently, then connect a client.

```shell
./build/Debug/bin/clice server --mode socket --port 50051
```

After the server starts, you can connect a client in two ways:

### Connect via pytest

Run a single integration test against the running instance:

```shell
pytest -s --log-cli-level=INFO \
    tests/integration/lifecycle/test_file_operation.py::test_did_open \
    --mode=socket --port=50051
```

### Connect via VS Code

Configure the clice extension to connect to your running instance:

1. Install the [clice](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ykiko.clice-vscode) extension.

2. Configure `.vscode/settings.json`:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "clice.executable": "/path/to/your/clice/executable",
     "clice.mode": "socket",
     "clice.port": 50051,
     // Optional: disable clangd if also installed
     "clangd.path": "",
   }
   ```

3. Reload Window (`Developer: Reload Window`) for settings to take effect.

### Debug the VS Code extension

The extension lives in-tree at `editors/vscode/`:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd editors/vscode
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Open the **repository root** in VS Code (the launch configurations are in `.vscode/launch.json` at the root).

3. Create `.vscode/settings.json` with the socket config above.

4. Press `F5` and select `VSCode Extension (pipe)` or `VSCode Extension (socket)` to launch an Extension Development Host window.
